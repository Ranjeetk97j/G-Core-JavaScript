Object Oriented Programming
==========================================================================
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized
around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic.

OOPS aisi model hai jisme object se bani hui model hoti hai siwaye functio ke

Concepts of OOP
==================================
1). Encapsulation
2). Abstraction
3). Inheriance
4). Polymorbhism

===========================================================================
Objects
===========================================================================
An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association 
between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function,
in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects 
that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.

var fees={
    Rahul: 100;|
    Sumit: 200;|---- properties
    Rohan: 300;|
    total: function() {return (100+200+300);}----Methods  
};
=============================================
Type of Objects
==============================================
1). User-Defined Objects:- These are custom objects created by the programmer
    to bringg structure and consistency to a particular programming task.

2). Nativ Objects:- These are provided by the javascript language itself
    like String, Number, Boolean, Function, Date, Object, Array, Math,
    RegExp, Error as well as object that allow creation of user-defined
    objects and composite types.
    
3). Host Objects:- These objects are not specified as part of the JavaScript
    language but that are supported by most host environments, typically
    browsers like window, navigator.

4). Document Objects:- These are part of the document object model (DOM),
    as defined by the W3C. These objects presents the programmer with a 
    structured interface to HTML and XML documents. Access to the document
    objects is provided by the browser via the document property of the 
    window object (window.document).

Declaration And Initialization of Object
============================================================================
>Using Object Literal
Syntax:- var object_name ={}
Ex:-
   var fees={};
   Fees["Rahul"]=100; -----> Fees.Rahul=100;
   Fees["Sumit"]=200; -----> Fees.Sumit=200;
   Fees["Rohan"]=300; -----> Fees.Rohan=300;

   Fee["Super Man"]=400; ------> Fees.Super Man=400;
